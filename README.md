An interactive cell architecture gallery built with React, Vite, Three.js, and staged GLB or procedural 3D cell assets. The project recreates a premium educational biology interface with selectable cell types, organelle details, comparison mode, responsive layout, and visual verification coverage.

## Highlights

- Seven specimen views: plant cell, white blood cell, neuron, epithelial cell, bacteria cell, animal cell, and muscle cell.
- High fidelity Plant Cell and White Blood Cell GLB rendering with native texture preservation.
- Mesh first experience with 3D canvas rendering as the default view.
- AI Tutor panel with learning prompts, lesson focus, and mastery tracking.
- Model loading overlay for large GLB assets on slower networks.
- Procedural fallback geometry for specimens that do not yet have production GLB assets.
- Detail panel for organelles, microscope modes, specimen metadata, and comparison workflow.
- Responsive desktop, compact, and mobile layouts with browser screenshot verification.

## Preview Modes

| Mode | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Mesh | Loads available GLB models or procedural Three.js geometry. |
| Focus | Emphasizes selected organelles and supporting biological details. |

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Tools |
| --- | --- |
| App | React 19, TypeScript, Vite |
| 3D | Three.js, React Three Fiber, Drei |
| UI | CSS modules in `src/styles.css`, Lucide icons |
| Assets | GLB models, transparent PNG thumbnails, NIH previews |
| Verification | Playwright Core, PNG pixel metrics |

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the local development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open the app:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:5173/
```

Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Run visual verification:

```bash
npm run verify
```

## Asset Notes

The highest fidelity specimens are loaded from `public/models/` and configured in `src/data/cells.ts`.

| Specimen | Current asset |
| --- | --- |
| Plant Cell | `public/models/plant-cell-first001.glb` |
| White Blood Cell | `public/models/white-blood-cell-user.glb` |
| Animal Cell | `public/models/animal-cell-nih.glb` |
| Neuron | `public/models/neuron-nih.glb` |
| Bacteria Wall | `public/models/bacteria-wall-nih.glb` |

Transparent PNG references in `public/cell-renders-transparent/` are used for thumbnails and model previews. Detailed provenance is tracked in `docs/ASSETS.md`.

## Verification

`npm run verify` launches the local app, captures desktop, compact, mobile, and interaction screenshots, then checks canvas pixel metrics to catch blank renders or major layout regressions.

Current coverage includes:

- Desktop, compact, and mobile smoke checks.
- Plant Cell GLB render check.
- White Blood Cell GLB render check.
- Bacteria mesh interaction check.
- Comparison modal check.

## Roadmap

- Add production quality GLB models for the remaining specimens.
- Add lazy loading and route level code splitting for 3D bundles.
- Expand educational annotations for each organelle.
- Add screenshot export and 3D export workflows.
- Add asset license metadata directly into the UI.

The application code is licensed under the MIT License. Included GLB models and image assets retain their documented provenance in `docs/ASSETS.md`.
